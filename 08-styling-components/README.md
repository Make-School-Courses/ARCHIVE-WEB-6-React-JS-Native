# Collaboration

Collabortion is a big part of software development. You'll need to collaborate 
on personal projects to get them done. You will want to collaborate on 
interesting projects you might come across. Your role at any company in the 
future will involve lots collaboration. 

GitHub has become an inportant, highly used, and very popular collaboration 
tool. It's used by companies large and small, and independant developers.
It's almost certian you will be collaborating on work through GitHub in the 
future. 

## The Challenges

You should have completed Weather project. Your job is to put your weather 
project on a GitHub repo. Maybe there is someone else in the world with your
passion for weather and React Native that wants to collaborate!

### Challenge 1

1. Add your React Weather project to GitHub. 

You better add some topics to the repo to make it discoverable. You want 
people who have the same interests to find your work. 

2. Click "Manage Topics" near the top of the repo in GitHub. 

![github-topics.png](github-topics.png)

Add these topics and any others oyu think are appropriate: react-native, 
weather, web6

3. Edit the read to describe the project and add notes.

**!Note:** if you created the project with "Create React Native App" 
it will come with a README.md that has all of the information for 
Create React Native apps. To clarify things for potential collaborators 
you should do one of two things. 

- Add a your information to the current README.md at the _top_. Add a heading
at the beginning of the "Creat React Native App" info. 
- Or, Rename this README to something like: "create-react-native-app.md" 
and add a new README.md with your project description and a link to the 
create react native info under a heading: Create React Native App. 
The link might look like this: 

`[Create React Native App](create-react-native-app.md)`

4. Post a link to your Repo in the class Slack channel. 

5. Wait patiently...



### Challenge 2

Finding a project where you can make a meaningful contribution is  
hard when you are beginning. A good strategy is to look for smaller 
projects run by people like yourself. 

You have an interest in and experience with JavaScript, React Native, 
and the weather, I bet there are a few like this on GiHub right now!

1. Find a project from another student. 
  - Choose the project below your project in Slack. If you are the last 
  project choose the first on the list. 
2. Fork that project. 
3. Look through the code and identify areas where you can make a 
contribution meaningful.
4. Make a pull request. 

### Challenge 3 

When you collaborate on projects you never know about the quality of the 
work you will get. You also never know when a contribution will be 
offered. You should always accept good work if you can. 

1. Examine any pull requests you get. 
2. Comment on lines of code and using the GitHub interface. 
3. Merge work that you think is good quality and adds value to your project. 
4. Solve any merge conflicts that arise.
