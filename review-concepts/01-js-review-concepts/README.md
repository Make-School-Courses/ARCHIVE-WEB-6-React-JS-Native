# JS Basic Concepts

Knowledge of JavaScript is essential to working with React. The components you create 
and the logic that makes them work will all be written in React. The goal of this lesson 
is review and practice basic JavaScript, especially features that apply React. 

## Class Competencies

By the of this class students should be able to:

- Define JS Concepts: Types, Objects, Scope
- Identify common methods of Array
- Distinguish between a reference and a copy when working with objects and arrays
- Use Map Filter and Reduce to solve problems with JS

### Overview 

After a short dicussion students split into groups each tasked with discussing one 
of the topics below. After discussion with the group, each group presents their 
conclusions to the class. 

Break

Short lecture on Map, Filter, and Reduce, after which students work through the 
challenges in pairs. 

## JavaScript Concepts 

Three JavaScript concepts that will be important to React. 

### Objects

JavaScript supports 5 primitives everything else is objects. With your group discuss
Objects in JavaScript and define a short list of the most important features of 
Objects.

### Array Map Filter Reduce

Array's are one of the most important methods for storing and organizing data. 
Discuss Arrays with your group and present a short overview of the most important 
methods of Array.

### Scope

Scope is an important topic. Discuss scope with your group and present a short 
dicussion explaining scope. 

### Classes

_Bonus topic_

Discuss classes in JavaScript with your group. Present a short discussion to the group 
on Classes in JavaScript.

### Challenges

Complete the following challenges to test your knowledge of the JS concepts covered above. 
(The challenges also appear in comments at the bottom of the example.)

...Rewrite these with better focus...

- Create a function that takes a name and title and returns an object containing these two properties
The object should look something like: {name: "Rudolf", title: "leader of the pack"}
- Define an array (nameTitle) then push 5 name/title objects from your function.
- Write a function that takes a letter (a, b, c, etc) and returns an array containg all of the
names from nameTitle that begin with that letter. Use array.filter.
- Write a function takes a title, and returns an array of all objects that have a matching title. 
Use filter again.
- Write a function that returns an array containing strings made from the names and titles. 
Each string should look like: "Name Title" or "Diana the duchess of york" or something similar. 
Use array.map().
- Create an array of random numbers. Bonus: Use a loop and add 100 random numbers or write a function to return an array of any number of random numbers. 
- Write a function that returns an aray of all numbers 0.5 and above. use filter, map, or reduce. 
- Write a function that returns an array of all numbers below 0.5. Use filter, map, or reduce. 
- Write a function that returns the total of all random numbers. Use filter, map, or reduce. 
- Write a function that returns the average of all of the random numbers. Use filter, map, or reduce.
