### Overview 

CSS is required, but React is so far off from the standard methods used with the web
the usual best prsctices for CSS don't always apply. 

Discuss the pros and cons of class name styles vs inline styles with your neighbor. 

#### Stylesheets and class names 

This is the usual best practice. While it works with React and may be the best choice

In non-React projects this would be considered least optimal for many reasons. In React 
inline styles have some advatages.
