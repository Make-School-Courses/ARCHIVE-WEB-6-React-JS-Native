If this example is interesting try these extra challenges. 

- Style the project and make it presentable. 
- Use an image for the X and O rather than text. 
- Move the whole project into the single-file-react-starter. 
- When a player places their fourth move their first move should be removed from the board. 
This makes for a different kind of game. 
- Make the Board Component able to create a board of any size i.e. 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 etc.
