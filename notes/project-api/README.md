# API Project

Your goal for this project is to create a React or React Native project that 
makes use of an API. To pass this class you must complete this project before 
the end of the term. 

## Discussion 

Application programming Interface or API refers to methods of communication 
between software components. While APIs exist for operating systems, databases
hardware, and software libraries, this discussion will focus on web-based APIs. 

- What is an API? 
- Why use an API?
- What kinds of apps would use an API?
  - Are there apps that would not use an API?

## Project Description 

Your goal is to create a project using a web API. Your project should be built 
with React or React Native.

### Scope

The most important thing to keep in mind while you work on this project is to 
keep scope in check. To pass the class you must complete the projects before
the end of the term. You can add more features later or expand on your concept 
in later versions.

### Requirements

Most APIs require you to register, some require fees. It's important to 
understand the requirements of the API you choose before you invest time and 
energy building your project to later find that the feature you need requires 
a fee or has a limit that will hobble your project. This is the most 
important step of this project. 

Consider the platform carefully. Some features may be available on native but 
not available in the browser. Before starting to build your project list 
hardware and software features you require and research them for your chosen
platform. 

### Ideas and APIs

You can use any API in any way you like. Your app can be anything you 
care to invent from mundane to strange. Here are a few ideas with descriptions 
and the APIs that might be used. These ideas should be fairly simple and 
straightforward, you can expand on these keeping your ability and scope in mind.

## Technical Discussion 

Breaking desinging your project by sketching the content screens is a good 
place to start. This will allow you to identify components. 

The recommended way to set up network requests through JS is `fetch`.
