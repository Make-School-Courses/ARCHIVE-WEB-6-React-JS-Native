# Component Tutorial 

## Intro

React was created at Facebook to solve many of the problems Facebook 
encountered creating the Facebook web site. They have provided a 
pretty good tutorial that covers many of the features of React and 
points out some important concepts along the way. There is nothing 
better than learning from the source!

Pay close attention to the section on "lifting up state" this gets to 
a key aspect of React best practice. Digging deeper it says a lot 
about how React/Components differ from MVC architecture. 

Important points from the tutorial:

- Passing Data through props
- making Interactive Components
- Lifting up state

**Discussion**

- Outline the first couple problems 
- Pseudo code the challenge problems 
- Stub in component/methods/classes

## Projects
