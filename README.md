## Perequisites 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Course Overview

Web sites were originally conceived as linked static HTML pages. Over time the demands
of users and the ingenuity of developers has expanded the expectations and capabilities
of modern web sites and pushed them into the realm of full fledged applications. These
modern web sites are built around a single web page powered by JavaScript that acts as
a full fledged piece of software. Often called Single Page Applications or SPAs. 

This course focusses on modern front end web and mobile development with JavaScript. 
In this class you will build modern, forward thinking web and native mobile 
applications. Following industry standard practices using React, NPM, and Webpack. 

What makes React a good choice for building modern SPAs? React uses a Component 
based architecture. Components represent represent distinct UI elements. Components 
can be as simple or complex as you care to make them. Components are self contained 
and can be reused. Components are also composable. That is you can build large and 
complex components from many smaller components. The component based architecture is 
flexible and easy to work with.

## Competencies & Objectives 

1. Identify patterns used in building SPAs.
1. Construct Single Page Applications (SPA). 
1. Identify Reactive Programming Patterns.
1. Compare component based architecture to traditional patterns like MVC. 
1. Design applications built from components.
1. Create component based architecture. 
1. Create web and native apps from a JS code base.
