# WEB 6 - React JS/Native

## Perequisites 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Useful but not required

- Knowledge of iOS and Xcode

## Course Overview

Web sites were originally conceived as linked static HTML pages. Over time the demands
of users and the ingenuity of developers has expanded the expectations and capabilities
of modern web sites and pushed them into the realm of full fledged applications. These
modern web sites are built around a single web page powered by JavaScript that acts as
a full fledged piece of software, often called Single Page Applications or SPAs. 

Gmail was the first to prove you could make an amazing app with a single page. 

This course focusses on modern front end web and mobile development with JavaScript. 
In this class you will build modern, forward thinking web and native applications. 
The toolset will be React, React-Native, NPM, Webpack.  

What makes React a good choice for building modern SPAs? React uses a Component 
based architecture. React uses a unidirectional data flow which makes it perfect 
for making user interfaces, and improves on legacy methods.  

## Competencies & Objectives 

1. Identify patterns used in building SPAs.
1. Construct Single Page Applications (SPA). 
1. Identify Reactive Programming Patterns.
1. Compare component based architecture to traditional patterns like MVC. 
1. Design applications built from components.
1. Create component based architecture. 
1. Create web and native apps from a JS code base.

## Notes 

React is a popular library built on JavaScript. 
React is built on the functional reactive programming 
concepts. 

### Vocabulary

- React: A library created at FaceBook built on 
functional reactive programming concepts. 
- Functional programming: A style of progamming that 
emphasizes functions, immutable data, and avoids 
global state.
- ES6: The latest version of the JavaScript language.
